This code suffers from a subtle issue related to PHP's type juggling and the behavior of the `==` operator.  When comparing a string '0' with a numerical value 0 using `==`, PHP performs type coercion. In this instance, the string '0' is considered equal to the integer 0 because of this type coercion. However, if you use the strict comparison operator `===`, it checks for both value and type equality, and they will be considered different.

```php
<?php
$stringZero = '0';
$intZero = 0;

if ($stringZero == $intZero) {
  echo "Values are equal using ==\n";
}

if ($stringZero === $intZero) {
  echo "Values are equal using ===\n";
} else {
  echo "Values are NOT equal using ===\n";
}
?>
```
